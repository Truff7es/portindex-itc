        <h2>Computer Hardware and Software</h2>

        <p>
        <b>Hardware vs Software</b><br><br>

        <b>Hardware</b><br>
        Pertains to the physical components present in a computer that physically carry out the workload. 
        These include the processor, memory, storage devices, motherboard, PSU, input/output devices, and peripherals.
        <br><br>

        <b>Software</b><br>
        Refers to the non-physical programs and procedures that tell the hardware what to do. 
        Divided into system software, utility software, and application software.
        </p>

        <h2>Hardware</h2>
        <p>
        Hardware refers to the physical components of a computer system—such as the CPU, memory, storage devices, 
        and input/output peripherals—that work together to perform computing tasks. Major components include the 
        CPU, RAM, storage devices, motherboard, PSU, input devices, output devices, and peripherals.
        </p>

        <h2>Software</h2>
        <p>
        Software refers to the non-physical programs and procedures that instruct hardware on what tasks to perform. 
        It is divided into:
        <br><br>
        • <b>System Software</b> — operating systems, device drivers<br>
        • <b>Utility Software</b> — antivirus, file management, cleanup tools<br>
        • <b>Application Software</b> — word processors, spreadsheets, browsers, graphics tools
        </p>

        <h2>Types of Software</h2>
        <p>
        <b>System Software</b><br>
        Manages and controls computer hardware; includes Windows, Linux, macOS, and device drivers.
        <br><br>

        <b>Utility Software</b><br>
        Performs maintenance and optimization; includes antivirus programs, file compression tools, disk cleanup.
        <br><br>

        <b>Application Software</b><br>
        Allows users to perform specific tasks such as document creation, data analysis, browsing, and design.
        </p>

        <h2>Analysis</h2>
        <p>
        Computers are perhaps the greatest invention of the last century. Naturally, a complex construct consists of multiple parts 
        facilitating the processes involved in computing. These are categorized into hardware and software. 
        <br><br>
        Hardware encompasses the physical components, such as the CPU, RAM, storage, motherboard, and peripherals. 
        Software refers to the programs that instruct the hardware, split into system, utility, and application software. 
        <br><br>
        Both work in tandem to serve the user's needs. Computers are used in companies, universities, hospitals, and more. 
        Their contribution to modern life is immense, improving quality of life in ways once unimaginable.
